	Goals of util.js:
	
	simple, easy to learn, lightweight, powerfull,
	specially made for apps, multiple languages & formats,
	string formatting, number & currency formatting 
	
	Util proper is the two files validations.js and util.js 

	String formatting (util proper):
	
	1) Capitalizes first non-tag string character of string or dot terminated phrases
	2) Adds space after dot in a phrase
	3) Removes double space
	4) Leaves abbreviations as they are
	5) Truncates to number of characters and tries to round up on space
	6) Adds an optional string or ' ...' (to the last open fitting tag) when the string has been truncated

	eg. 
	
	document.ready(function() // If using the loader
	{
		var msg = 'fits in as many words as possible when first word in string is shorter then limit'
			.toLimitedFormattedHTML(23)
			
		// msg now eq: 'Fits in as many words ...'
	})
	
	// strip all dots and space:
		util.trim('1000 AA', true)
		
	// format numbers
		var res = 'average of &%'.format([1.5], 'precision:1', '&')

	// handle input			
		util.trim(null).isEmpty()
	
	// or with a struct:	
		var msg = new util.struct([String], {msg1:'Hi there %', msg2:'Bye '})
		var d = msg.format.apply(msg.data.msg1, [[1.5], 'float:4'])
		var m = msg.toLimitedFormattedText.apply(d, [15])
